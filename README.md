# Vets Who Code Extension Pack

One of the things I am always trying to do is find a way to make it easier for our students to learn how to code, and one way to do that is making the tools they use easier to find. So instead of sending them a list of plugins to download, I wanted to build a plugin that can grow that we add stuff to so that they can be prepared. Part of being a master educator is flattening the curve of learning to help others get to where you were faster.
